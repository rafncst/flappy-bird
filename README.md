# flappy-bird
A project using HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and CSS Grid) and Javascript. The goal was using these languages to make a game that resembles the well known Flappy Bird mobile app. And by doing so, learning more about the way these different tools intertwine in a DOM.
This also helped me practice OOP. Since constructors, setters and getters were used to create the elements to be implemented into the DOM. Also, OOP concepts were used, such as abstraction and inheritance.
My goal now is to lower the amount of hard-coded lines in the project (These can be seen, for exemple, in the limitations imposed on the bird's course of movement and the reset position for the game barriers in the js file.)
